Cocos2D-XNA-Tutorials
=====================

This solution provides the following tutorials on using the Cocos2D-XNA framework.  To eliminate any confusion, this is a personal project not related the Cocos2D-XNA framework itself.  I'm writing these tutorials as a learning project for myself as I become familiar with the excellent Cocos2D-XNA framework, so I don't pretend to be an expert. :)  There may be parts of the code that could better utilize the framework than what's being done; at this point, I'd chalk it up to ignorance over any particular way of doing things.

* Basic Sprites
Basic Sprites is a simple project that explores some of the basic mechanics of sprites in Cocos2D-XNA.  It provides a simple background and sprite layer, allowing different operations to be performed on the sprites.  It is by no means exhaustive, but it covers a lot of the standard operations (visibility, rotation, scaling, z-order, opacity, etc.)
